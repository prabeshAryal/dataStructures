# Lists

## Introduction to Lists

A **list** is a built-in data structure in Python that allows you to store multiple items in a single variable. It is one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures in Python, owing to its dynamic nature and ease of use.

### Key Features of Lists:
- **Ordered**: Items in a list are stored in a specific order.
- **Mutable**: The elements in a list can be changed (modified, added, or removed).
- **Dynamic**: The size of a list can grow or shrink as needed.
- **Heterogeneous**: A list can store elements of different data types.

## Syntax for Creating a List

To create a list, use square brackets `[]` and separate elements with commas.

```python
# Example of creating lists
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mixed = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]
```

## Accessing Elements in a List

You can access elements of a list using their **index**, which starts from `0`.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Access elements by index
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
print(fruits[1])  # Output: banana

# Negative indexing (from the end of the list)
print(fruits[-1])  # Output: cherry
```

## Modifying a List

Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their content.

### 1. Changing Elements
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits[1] = "blueberry"
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry']
```

### 2. Adding Elements
```python
# Using append() to add a single element
fruits.append("orange")
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'orange']

# Using extend() to add multiple elements
fruits.extend(["grape", "mango"])
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'orange', 'grape', 'mango']

# Using insert() to add an element at a specific position
fruits.insert(1, "kiwi")
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'kiwi', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'orange', 'grape', 'mango']
```

### 3. Removing Elements
```python
# Using remove() to delete a specific element
fruits.remove("cherry")
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'kiwi', 'blueberry', 'orange', 'grape', 'mango']

# Using pop() to remove an element by index
fruits.pop(2)
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'kiwi', 'orange', 'grape', 'mango']

# Using del to delete an element by index or a slice
del fruits[0]
print(fruits)  # Output: ['kiwi', 'orange', 'grape', 'mango']

# Clearing all elements using clear()
fruits.clear()
print(fruits)  # Output: []
```

## Common List Operations

### 1. Iterating Through a List
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Using a for loop
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry
```

### 2. List Comprehension
A concise way to create lists.

```python
# Create a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 5
squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

### 3. Checking Membership
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print("apple" in fruits)   # Output: True
print("mango" not in fruits)  # Output: True
```

## List Functions and Methods

Here are some commonly used functions and methods for lists:

| Method/Function       | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `len(list)`           | Returns the number of elements in the list.                                |
| `list.append(x)`      | Adds an element `x` to the end of the list.                                |
| `list.extend(iter)`   | Extends the list by appending elements from another iterable.              |
| `list.insert(i, x)`   | Inserts an element `x` at index `i`.                                       |
| `list.remove(x)`      | Removes the first occurrence of the element `x`.                          |
| `list.pop([i])`       | Removes and returns the element at index `i` (default: last element).      |
| `list.clear()`        | Removes all elements from the list.                                        |
| `list.index(x)`       | Returns the index of the first occurrence of the element `x`.             |
| `list.count(x)`       | Returns the number of occurrences of the element `x`.                     |
| `list.sort()`         | Sorts the list in ascending order (or based on a custom key).             |
| `list.reverse()`      | Reverses the elements of the list in place.                               |

Example:
```python
numbers = [4, 2, 8, 6, 2]
print(len(numbers))         # Output: 5
print(numbers.count(2))     # Output: 2

numbers.sort()
print(numbers)              # Output: [2, 2, 4, 6, 8]

numbers.reverse()
print(numbers)              # Output: [8, 6, 4, 2, 2]
```

## Applications of Lists

1. **Storing Collections**: Store related items, such as names, scores, or configurations.
2. **Dynamic Arrays**: Use lists to dynamically grow or shrink arrays.
3. **Matrix Representation**: Represent 2D arrays or grids using nested lists.
    ```python
    matrix = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [7, 8, 9]
    ]
    print(matrix[1][2])  # Output: 6
    ```

4. **Data Processing**: Useful for filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.
